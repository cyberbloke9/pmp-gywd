Purpose: Users need to quickly find the right command for their situation.
Output: Restructured command reference with clear categories

**Current state:**
- 40 commands listed in categories
- Current categories: Intelligence, Setup, Planning, Execution, Progress & Analysis, Memory & Session, Roadmap Management, Milestone Management, Integration, Utility

**Issues:**
- Some categories have too many commands
- Purpose descriptions could be more action-oriented
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Reorganize command categories</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Restructure command reference into clearer categories:

**Core Workflow (daily use)**
- status, progress, resume-work, pause-work

**Project Setup**
- init, new-project, create-roadmap, bootstrap, map-codebase

**Planning**
- plan-phase, discuss-phase, research-phase, list-phase-assumptions, preview-plan

**Execution**
- execute-plan, verify-work, plan-fix

**Understanding Code**
- why, history, extract-decisions, anticipate, challenge

**Analysis**
- context, health, deps, check-drift, digest, consider-issues

**Roadmap**
- add-phase, insert-phase, remove-phase, complete-milestone, discuss-milestone, new-milestone

**Memory & Profile**
- memory, profile

**Integration**
- sync-github, rollback

**Help**
- help

This reordering puts frequently-used commands first.
  </action>
  <verify>Command categories are reorganized with daily-use commands first</verify>
  <done>Commands are in user-centric categories</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Improve command descriptions</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update command descriptions to be more action-oriented:

Examples of improvements:
- "Complete command reference" → "Show all available commands"
- "Developer digital twin" → "View/manage your learned preferences"
- "Detailed progress + routing" → "See what's next and resume work"

Each description should answer: "What will happen when I run this?"
Keep descriptions to 5-8 words max.
  </action>
  <verify>Command descriptions are action-oriented and concise</verify>
  <done>All 40 commands have clear, actionable descriptions</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Commands reorganized into user-centric categories
- [ ] Daily-use commands appear first
- [ ] All descriptions are action-oriented
- [ ] No commands missing from the list
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 2 tasks completed
- Users can find the right command faster
- Categories make logical sense
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-readme-overhaul/10-03-SUMMARY.md`
