**Current state:**

- Philosophy section exists
- Troubleshooting is brief
- Footer exists

**Goal:**
- Ensure all sections flow well together
- Polish formatting consistency
- Add any missing information

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Streamline Library Modules section</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Simplify the Library Modules section:

1. Keep the section but reduce code examples to essentials
2. Show one import example per category (not all exports)
3. Keep "Zero Runtime Dependencies" note
4. Add note about where to find full API docs (future Phase 12)

Example format:
```javascript
// Memory (v3.2)
const { GlobalMemory, TeamSync } = require('pmp-gywd/lib/memory');

// Profile & Questioning
const { ProfileManager, QuestionEngine } = require('pmp-gywd/lib/profile');

// Context & Automation
const { ContextPredictor, DependencyAnalyzer } = require('pmp-gywd/lib/context');
```
  </action>
  <verify>Library Modules section is under 40 lines</verify>
  <done>Library section is concise with clear examples</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update CI/CD and Philosophy sections</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Polish these sections:

**CI/CD:**
1. Keep the bullet list of capabilities
2. Keep the npm commands
3. Remove redundant "(22 test suites)" - mentioned elsewhere

**Philosophy:**
1. Keep the quote
2. Streamline the version evolution to one line per version
3. Keep the paradigm shift explanation

**Recommended Setup:**
1. Keep as-is (it's already concise)
  </action>
  <verify>CI/CD and Philosophy sections are clean</verify>
  <done>Both sections are polished</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Expand Troubleshooting and finalize</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Improve Troubleshooting:

1. Add 2-3 more common issues:
   - "Commands run but nothing happens" → Check .planning/ exists
   - "Plan execution stuck" → Try /gywd:progress to see state
   - "Lost context mid-session" → Use /gywd:resume-work

2. Add "Contributing" section (brief):
   - Link to GitHub issues
   - Note about 557 tests requirement

3. Ensure footer is clean:
   - Keep "Understand decisions. Ship coherent code."
   - Keep attribution

4. Final formatting pass:
   - Consistent heading levels
   - Consistent code block language hints
   - No trailing whitespace
  </action>
  <verify>Troubleshooting has 5+ items, Contributing section exists</verify>
  <done>README is complete and polished</done>
</task>
