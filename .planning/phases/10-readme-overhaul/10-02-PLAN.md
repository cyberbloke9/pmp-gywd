**Current state:**
- "Getting Started" is 3 steps spread across multiple sections
- Two separate paths (Fresh Project / Existing Codebase) are good but verbose

**Goal:**
- Single "Getting Started" section with 3 clear steps
- Paths explained concisely with command examples
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Consolidate Getting Started into 3 steps</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite "Getting Started" section:

```markdown
## Getting Started

### 1. Install

\`\`\`bash
npx pmp-gywd
\`\`\`

Choose **global** (all projects) or **local** (this project only).

### 2. Verify

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:help
\`\`\`

### 3. Start Working

**New project?** → `/gywd:new-project`
**Existing code?** → `/gywd:bootstrap`
```

Remove the separate "Step 1/2/3" verbose sections currently in place.
  </action>
  <verify>Read Getting Started section - should be under 20 lines</verify>
  <done>Getting Started is 3 clear steps in under 20 lines</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Simplify user journey sections</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Condense "Starting Fresh" and "Existing Codebase" sections:

For each path, reduce to:
1. One-liner description
2. Primary command
3. What happens (3-4 bullet points max)
4. Example flow (3-4 commands max)

Remove:
- Verbose "How It Helps You" tables (move to separate docs if needed)
- Redundant explanations

Target: Each path section under 40 lines (currently ~60 each)
  </action>
  <verify>Read both path sections - each should be under 40 lines</verify>
  <done>Both user journey sections are concise</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add "Quick Reference" summary table</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Improve the existing "Quick Reference: Which Command When?" section:

1. Move it right after Getting Started (before the detailed path sections)
2. Keep it as a simple 2-column table
3. Ensure it covers the 8-10 most common situations
4. Add a note: "See `/gywd:help` for all 40 commands"

This gives users a quick decision tree without scrolling.
  </action>
  <verify>Quick Reference table is positioned early and covers common scenarios</verify>
  <done>Quick reference is easily findable and comprehensive</done>
</task>
