<objective>
Create a comprehensive Getting Started guide for new users.

Purpose: Walk users from zero to their first successful GYWD workflow.
Output: docs/GETTING-STARTED.md with step-by-step tutorial
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/get-your-work-done/workflows/execute-phase.md

</execution_context>

<context>
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@README.md

**Current state:**
- README has streamlined Getting Started (3 steps)
- No separate tutorial documentation exists
- docs/ directory does not exist

**Goal:**
- Create docs/ directory
- Create comprehensive GETTING-STARTED.md
- Cover both new project and existing codebase paths
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create docs directory and guide structure</name>
  <files>docs/GETTING-STARTED.md</files>
  <action>
Create docs/ directory and GETTING-STARTED.md with this structure:

```markdown
# Getting Started with GYWD

> From zero to your first AI-assisted feature in 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Claude Code CLI installed
- A project to work on (or an idea for one)

## Installation

### Quick Install

\`\`\`bash
npx pmp-gywd
\`\`\`

Choose:
- **Global** - Available in all projects (recommended)
- **Local** - This project only

### Verify Installation

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:help
\`\`\`

You should see 40 commands listed.

## Choose Your Path

| Your Situation | Start Here |
|----------------|------------|
| New idea, starting fresh | [Path A: New Project](#path-a-new-project) |
| Existing codebase | [Path B: Existing Codebase](#path-b-existing-codebase) |
```

This establishes the document structure and prerequisites.

  <done>Guide structure created with installation section</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Path A - New Project tutorial</name>
  <files>docs/GETTING-STARTED.md</files>
  <action>
Add the "Path A: New Project" section with detailed walkthrough:

```markdown
## Path A: New Project

**Time:** ~5 minutes

You have an idea and want to build it from scratch.

### Step 1: Define Your Project

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:new-project
\`\`\`

GYWD will ask you about:
- What problem you're solving
- Who the users are
- Core features
- Technical preferences

**Example answers:**
- Problem: "I want to track my daily habits"
- Users: "Just me, for personal use"
- Features: "Add habits, mark complete, see streaks"
- Tech: "Node.js CLI app"

After answering, GYWD creates:
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` - Your vision documented
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Session memory
- Your developer profile (learns your patterns)

### Step 2: Create Your Roadmap

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:create-roadmap
\`\`\`

GYWD breaks your idea into phases. For example:
- Phase 1: Core data model
- Phase 2: CLI interface
- Phase 3: Streak tracking

Creates `.planning/ROADMAP.md` with the full plan.

### Step 3: Plan Your First Phase

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:plan-phase 1
\`\`\`

Creates a detailed task plan in `.planning/phases/01-*/01-01-PLAN.md`.

### Step 4: Execute!

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:execute-plan
\`\`\`

GYWD builds your first phase with AI assistance, tracking every decision.

### Step 5: Continue Tomorrow

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:progress
\`\`\`

See where you left off and what's next.
```
  </action>
  <verify>Path A section covers full new project workflow</verify>
  <done>New project tutorial complete</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add Path B - Existing Codebase tutorial</name>
  <files>docs/GETTING-STARTED.md</files>
  <action>
Add the "Path B: Existing Codebase" section:

```markdown
## Path B: Existing Codebase

**Time:** ~5 minutes

You have code and want GYWD to understand it.

### Step 1: Analyze Your Codebase

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:bootstrap
\`\`\`

GYWD scans your code and creates:
- `.planning/codebase/STACK.md` - Technologies used
- `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Design patterns
- `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md` - Coding standards
- `.planning/core/decisions.json` - Decision graph from git history

### Step 2: Understand Existing Code

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:why src/auth/login.ts
\`\`\`

Traces any file back to its original decisions.

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:history "authentication"
\`\`\`

See how a feature evolved over time.

### Step 3: Add a New Feature

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:new-project
\`\`\`

Define what you're adding (GYWD respects existing architecture).

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:create-roadmap
/gywd:plan-phase 1
/gywd:execute-plan
\`\`\`

Build with full context awareness.

### Step 4: Daily Workflow

\`\`\`bash
/gywd:progress      # Start of day
/gywd:pause-work    # Before stopping
/gywd:resume-work   # Pick up where you left off
\`\`\`

## What's Next?

- **Deep dive:** Run `/gywd:help` for all 40 commands
- **Understand decisions:** Try `/gywd:why` on any file
- **Get reviews:** Use `/gywd:challenge` for adversarial feedback
