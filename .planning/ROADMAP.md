# ROADMAP: PMP-GYWD v1.4.0

## The Paradigm Shift

**v1.0-1.3**: Feature accumulation - more commands, more capabilities
**v1.4**: Paradigm shift - understanding decisions, not just generating code

**Core Insight**: Code is crystallized decisions. Every function, every pattern exists because someone made a decision with context we've often lost. v1.4 makes those decisions explicit and queryable.

## v1.4.0: Decision Intelligence

**Philosophy**: Understand WHY code exists, not just WHAT it does.

### New Systems

| System | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Decision Graph | `/gywd:extract-decisions` | Parse history into decision records |
| Temporal Queries | `/gywd:history` | Query codebase evolution |
| Adversarial Review | `/gywd:challenge` | Agents that attack plans/code |
| Predictive Context | `/gywd:anticipate` | Know what you need before asking |
| Developer Twin | `/gywd:profile` | Model of your patterns |
| Reality Integration | `/gywd:impact` | Connect code to outcomes |
| Why Queries | `/gywd:why` | Answer "why does this exist?" |

### Research Foundation

Built on:
- METR 2025: Developers 19% slower with AI (perception gap)
- Cognitive science: 4±1 working memory chunks, 23 min focus recovery
- Kasparov: Weak human + weak AI + great process > strong AI alone
- Kleppmann: Formal verification goes mainstream via AI

## The Vision Beyond

### v2.0 Direction

Full implementation of the 7 behemoth systems:
1. Complete Decision Graph with causal linking
2. Developer Digital Twin with persistent modeling
3. Temporal Codebase as first-class citizen
4. Adversarial Swarm with competing agents
5. Semantic Compiler with formal verification
6. Predictive Development with anticipation engine
7. Reality-Grounded Development with outcome linking

See VISION.md for full architectural vision.
