# ROADMAP: PMP-GYWD v2.0.0

## The Evolution

**v1.0-1.3**: Feature accumulation - more commands, more capabilities
**v1.4**: Paradigm shift - understanding decisions, not just generating code
**v2.0**: Unified intelligence - all systems work as one cognitive whole

**Core Insight**: Code is crystallized decisions. v2.0 builds a unified intelligence system that understands decisions, predicts context, learns continuously, and orchestrates specialized agents.

## v2.0.0: Unified Intelligence System

**Philosophy**: All intelligence systems work as a unified cognitive whole.

### Core Architecture

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Decision Graph Engine | Store, link, and query all decisions | ✅ |
| Context Intelligence Engine | Predict and manage context optimally | ✅ |
| Agent Orchestrator | Coordinate multiple AI agents | ✅ |
| Continuous Learning System | Improve with every interaction | ✅ |

### New Command

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/gywd:bootstrap` | Initialize complete v2.0 system on any codebase |

### Core Infrastructure Files

```
get-your-work-done/core/
├── architecture.md           # Unified system architecture
├── decisions-schema.json     # Decision graph data structure
├── context-model-schema.json # Context intelligence model
├── learning-state-schema.json# Learning system state
├── profile-schema.json       # Developer Digital Twin schema
└── agent-patterns.md         # Agent orchestration patterns
```

### Bootstrap Process

The `/gywd:bootstrap` command runs 6 phases in one command:
1. **Codebase Analysis** - Structure, stack, patterns (parallel agents)
2. **Decision Extraction** - Git history, docs, code patterns
3. **Context Model** - File relationships, predictions, budget
4. **Developer Profile** - Expertise, preferences, patterns
5. **Learning System Init** - Feedback tracking, baselines
6. **Project Setup** - PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md

## v1.4.0: Decision Intelligence

**Philosophy**: Understand WHY code exists, not just WHAT it does.

### New Systems

| System | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Decision Graph | `/gywd:extract-decisions` | Parse history into decision records |
| Temporal Queries | `/gywd:history` | Query codebase evolution |
| Adversarial Review | `/gywd:challenge` | Agents that attack plans/code |
| Predictive Context | `/gywd:anticipate` | Know what you need before asking |
| Developer Twin | `/gywd:profile` | Model of your patterns |
| Reality Integration | `/gywd:impact` | Connect code to outcomes |
| Why Queries | `/gywd:why` | Answer "why does this exist?" |

### Research Foundation

Built on:
- METR 2025: Developers 19% slower with AI (perception gap)
- Cognitive science: 4±1 working memory chunks, 23 min focus recovery
- Kasparov: Weak human + weak AI + great process > strong AI alone
- Kleppmann: Formal verification goes mainstream via AI

## The Vision Beyond

### v2.0 Direction

Full implementation of the 7 behemoth systems:
1. Complete Decision Graph with causal linking
2. Developer Digital Twin with persistent modeling
3. Temporal Codebase as first-class citizen
4. Adversarial Swarm with competing agents
5. Semantic Compiler with formal verification
6. Predictive Development with anticipation engine
7. Reality-Grounded Development with outcome linking
